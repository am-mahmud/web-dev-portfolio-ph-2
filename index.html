            <h4>I’ve spent a couple of decades… okay, more like a couple of seasons… acting, <br> learning what makes a story really click with people. co-run this place called. <br> The Workshop — it’s kind of like a studio, but fancier — where I collaborate on <br>big, brave ideas with some pretty awesome folks (and sometimes, sandwiches).</h4>
            <h4>Lately, I’ve been thinking… maybe it’s not just about <br>  the script or the set. Maybe what really makes <br> a brand — or a scene — work is the people.</h4>
            <h4>So I’m looking to work with teams who’ve got the talent, the energy, the whole creative crew… but something just isn’t clicking. Maybe it’s the culture. Maybe the <br> vision's fuzzy. Maybe the director keeps eating my props. I don’t know.</h4>
